I'm using Redis to maintain i have some informations. I've created this app to test the redis functionalities.

Now, I'm working in a project that manipulate a huge of informations, but some informations don't change during a period of time.
So, I've created a structure to maintain this information in chace for a period of time.

First of all, open your visual studio or vscode. I'm using visual studio comunity 2002.

File ->  new -> project - Console App.
